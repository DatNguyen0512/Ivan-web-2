Web Application Development Project
This project showcases various techniques used in the design and implementation of web applications. The project leverages development environments such as Dreamweaver, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, and SQL Management Studio to create a comprehensive web application. Below is a detailed overview of the technologies and methodologies used in this project.

Technologies and Tools
Browser-Side Development
HTML: Used for structuring the content of web pages.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): Applied for styling and layout of web pages.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Enables asynchronous data loading without refreshing the page.
Server-Side Development
Web Application Server:
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Java-based server-side scripting.
PHP: Server-side scripting for creating dynamic web pages.
C# .NET: Microsoft's framework for building web applications.
Database Server:
SQL (Structured Query Language): For querying and managing databases.
Stored Procedures: Precompiled SQL statements stored in the database.
Triggers: SQL code that automatically executes in response to certain events in the database.
Internet Protocols and Web Application Objects
Internet Protocols: Working with HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocols.
Web Application Objects: Handling objects such as request, response, and session.
Design Patterns
MVC (Model-View-Controller): Applying the MVC design pattern to create well-structured, maintainable web applications. This design pattern helps improve the organization and scalability of multi-tiered, distributed software.
Data Transfer and Web Services
XML (eXtensible Markup Language): A format commonly used for data transfer over the internet.
Web Services: Methods for making remote procedure calls over the internet to interact with web applications or services.
Project Structure
The project is organized into several components, each demonstrating different aspects of web application development:

Frontend: Contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Backend: Includes server-side scripts written in JSP, PHP, or C# .NET.
Database: Comprises SQL scripts for creating and managing the database, stored procedures, and triggers.
Web Services: Contains implementations of web services for data exchange and remote procedure calls.
Design Patterns: Examples of MVC implementations and other design patterns applied in the project.
